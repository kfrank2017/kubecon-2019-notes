### Myth of the monocluster

Reduce failure point.

DNS always fails. Almost always the bottleneck. Sync back cluster DNS. On-prem.

API Server. That's your control pane. Scaling masters vertically. API server binary will have issues. Not reducing the blast radius. Keep scaling up. Scale virtual machines. That's only going to take you so far.

Can't rollback, can't scale up.

Control panes. Break loss. Difference of hardware. Abstract hardware. Singular control pane is a single point of failure.

Noisey neighbor is still issue in k8s. Plenty k8s does not correct far. Network. Disk io.

multi-tenancy has multiple dimensions.

multi-cluster is hard.

A dedicated platform team should run your clusters. Multiple different k8s means.

Teams as platform teams has failure modes. Especially if they had not used cloud before. Not focused on core app logic. Knowledge gets kept in team. Team tribal knowledge.

Team treats infrastructure as a pet. k8s is not noob friendly.
